# r00tz2016Documentation
Documentation for shellshock labs 

r00tz Asylum is open to anyone who is curious and open to learning new things, like encryption, information security, hardware engineering and more. The average age of kids coming to r00tz is between 8 and 16 years old.

This documentation runs students through the pentester & secops labs used at r00tz asylum 2016

I have not identified an adequate location for the VMs yet, but at some point I'll upload them somewhere. 

`//todo:`

1. Upload pentest scripts that help avoid typos to their own repository
2. Upload VMs somewhere
